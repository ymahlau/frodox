# Frodox: Fourier Simulation and Optimization of Diffractive Optical Elements with JAX

## Installation

TODO: You can install frodox simply via 

```bash
pip install frodox
```
We recommend installing also the GPU-acceleration from JAX, which will massively increase speed:
```bash
pip install jax[cuda]
```
